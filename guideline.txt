## 2. SKILLS & TECHNOLOGIES

### File: `client/src/lib/data.ts`

This file defines your skills, expertise percentages, and technologies.

### Data Skills

```typescript
export const dataSkills = [
  { name: "Python", percentage: 95 },
  { name: "Data Analysis", percentage: 90 },
  // Add or edit skills following the same format
  // Percentage should be between 0-100
];
```

];
```

### Technologies & Tools

Add or modify technology icons in the technologies array:

```typescript
export const technologies = [
  { name: "Technology Name", icon: IconComponent, iconClass: "text-color-shade" },
  // Example:
  { name: "Python", icon: SiPython, iconClass: "text-blue-500" },
];
```

#### Available Icons:
- Import from react-icons/si for technology icons (SiReact, SiPython, etc.)
- Import from react-icons/fa for FontAwesome icons
- Import from lucide-react for more generic icons

To add a new icon:
1. Import it at the top of the file
2. Add it to the technologies array with appropriate name and color class

---

## 3. PROJECTS

### File: `client/src/lib/data.ts`

Projects are defined in the projects array. Each project has the following structure:

```typescript
export const projects = [
  {
    title: "Project Title",
    description: "Detailed description of your project explaining what it does and the problems it solves.",
    image: "URL to project image", // Use direct URLs like https://i.imgur.com/yourImage.png or local paths like /images/projects/your-image.png
    category: "Project Category", // E.g., "Web App", "Data Analysis", "Mobile App"
    categoryClass: "bg-color-500", // Background color class for category label
    technologies: [
      { name: "Tech 1", class: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-600" },
      { name: "Tech 2", class: "bg-green-100 text-green-600" },
      // Add more technologies as needed
    ],
    demoLink: "URL to live demo",
    demoText: "Live Demo", // Button text, e.g., "Live Demo", "View Site", "App Store"
    codeLink: "URL to GitHub repository",
    featured: true, // Optional: Set to true to highlight this project
    // showOnHomepage: true // Alternative way to control homepage display (not currently implemented)
  },
  // Add more projects following the same format
];
```

### Adding a New Project:

1. Copy the template provided in the comments
2. Fill in your project details
3. Add the project object to the projects array
4. For the image, use a direct URL to your screenshot or local file in the public folder (e.g., `/images/projects/project-name.png`)
5. Choose appropriate category colors:
   - bg-blue-500: Data/Analytics projects
   - bg-green-500: Web/Mobile apps
   - bg-purple-500: Dashboard/Visualization
   - bg-primary: Default purple
   - bg-red-500: Backend/Infrastructure

### Project Display & Homepage Selection:

The portfolio displays projects in two locations:
1. **Main Page (Homepage)**: Shows up to 3 projects, with featured projects appearing first
2. **All Projects Page**: Shows all projects with filtering options

To control which projects appear on the homepage:
1. Mark important projects with `featured: true` to ensure they appear first
2. The homepage will only show the first 3 projects after sorting (featured ones first)
3. All projects will always be available on the All Projects page

For example:
```typescript
// This will appear on the homepage (as one of the first 3 projects)
{
  title: "Important Project",
  // other properties...
  featured: true,
}

// This might not appear on the homepage if there are already 3 featured projects
// But it will still be available on the All Projects page
{
  title: "Secondary Project",
  // other properties...
}
```

### Project Categories and Filtering:

The portfolio includes a filterable projects page that dynamically generates category filters based on your projects.

To work with project categories:
1. Set the `category` property of your project to any category name you want
   - Common categories: "Web App", "Mobile App", "Dashboard", "Data Analysis", "Web Scraping"
   - You can create any new category simply by using it in your project definition

2. The category filters on the All Projects page are automatically generated from the categories used in your projects
   - You don't need to manually update any filter list
   - Only categories that are actually used by at least one project will appear as filters

3. The `categoryClass` property defines the badge color shown on the project card but doesn't affect filtering

Example of adding a project with a completely new category:
```typescript
// In data.ts
{
  title: "Your Project",
  category: "Machine Learning", // New category that didn't exist before
  categoryClass: "bg-yellow-500", // Visual style only, doesn't affect filtering
  // ... other properties
}
```

The "Machine Learning" category will automatically appear in the filter options on the All Projects page.

### Highlighting Featured Projects:

To make a project stand out as a featured project:
1. Add `featured: true` to the project object
2. Featured projects will:
   - Appear at the top of the projects grid
   - Have a purple border with enhanced shadow effects
   - Display a pulsing star icon in the top corner
   - Have special hover effects

Example:
```typescript
{
  title: "My Important Project",
  // other project properties...
  featured: true, // This makes the project highlighted
}
```

### Using Local Images for Projects:

1. Place your project images in: `client/public/images/projects/`
2. Reference them in the project object using: `/images/projects/your-image-name.png`
3. Use image dimensions around 500x300px for optimal display
4. Ensure the images show up properly in both light and dark mode

---

## 4. THEME & STYLING

### Main CSS: `client/src/index.css`

This file contains global styles and theme colors.

### Theme Colors:

The theme colors are defined in the `:root` CSS variables. To change the primary color, modify the `--primary` CSS variable in both the light and dark themes.

### Favicon & Site Icons

The website uses a favicon with the letter "A" that appears in browser tabs and bookmarks.

#### Favicon Files:
- `client/public/favicon.svg` - Vector version with dark/light mode support
- `client/public/favicon.png` - Fallback PNG version for older browsers
- `client/public/apple-touch-icon.png` - Icon for iOS when added to home screen

To update the favicon:
1. **Edit the SVG file**:
   - The current favicon uses an SVG path for the "A" letter
   - This approach ensures maximum compatibility across browsers (including Firefox)
   - The circle background uses a purple gradient
   - The SVG supports both dark and light modes via CSS media queries

2. **Update PNG versions for maximum compatibility**:
   - Use the provided `favicon-generator.html` tool in the public folder
   - Open this file in a browser and use the download buttons to generate PNG versions
   - Replace the existing files in the `client/public/` directory

3. **Testing your favicon**:
   - Clear your browser cache to see favicon changes
   - Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Check both light and dark mode appearances
   - Verify that the "A" letter is clearly visible

### Tailwind Config: `tailwind.config.ts`

For more advanced styling customizations, edit the Tailwind config file.

## 5. SECTIONS & COMPONENTS

### Section Components: `client/src/components/sections/`

Each section of the website is defined in its own component:

- `Header.tsx`: Navigation and top banner
- `Hero.tsx`: Main landing section
- `About.tsx`: About information
- `Skills.tsx`: Skills visualization
- `Projects.tsx`: Projects display
- `Contact.tsx`: Contact form
- `Footer.tsx`: Page footer

To modify a section's structure or layout, edit the corresponding component file.

---

## 6. CONTACT FORM

### File: `client/src/components/sections/Contact.tsx`

The contact form is set up to send messages to your email via the server API.

To modify contact form fields or validation:

1. Edit the `ContactFormValues` interface to add/remove fields
2. Update the `zodSchema` validation rules
3. Add or modify form elements in the UI section

---

## 7. PAGES & ROUTES

### Pages: `client/src/pages/`

These files define full pages of the website:

- `Home.tsx`: Main landing page
- `Admin.tsx`: Admin panel (requires authentication)
- `Login.tsx`: Login page
- `AllProjects.tsx`: Projects portfolio page

### Routing: `client/src/App.tsx`

Page routes are defined in the App component using the wouter library.

To add a new page:
1. Create a new file in the pages directory
2. Add the route in App.tsx

---

## 8. DEPLOYMENT

The site is configured to deploy to Netlify automatically. The configuration is in `netlify.toml`.

To deploy manually:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. The built files will be in the `dist` directory
3. Deploy these files to your hosting provider

---

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. Always back up your changes before major edits
2. Test locally before deploying changes
3. Maintain consistency in styling and formatting
4. Keep image sizes optimized for web (under 500KB if possible)
5. Use proper image aspect ratios (ideally 16:9 or 4:3 for projects)
